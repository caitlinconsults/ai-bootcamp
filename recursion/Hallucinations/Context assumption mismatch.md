title: "Meta-Misunderstanding: ChatGPT and Human Confused ‘Project Instructions’ with Custom GPT Instructions Because We Didn’t Clarify Context Early"
date: 2025-07-05
context: In this conversation, we explored whether ChatGPT Project-level (folder-level) instructions override Custom GPT system prompts. Initially, there was confusion as the AI interpreted the question narrowly about standard chats, while the user meant launching a custom GPT within a Project. We clarified that Project instructions do not override Custom GPT embedded instructions, as Custom GPTs retain their own system prompts. The meta-problem was assuming shared definitions and context without explicitly aligning them early. This chat demonstrates rigorous clarification and epistemic validation methods for resolving AI-human misunderstandings.

## 🔎 Understanding Our Misunderstanding

### ✨ What happened?

In this conversation, we explored how ChatGPT Project instructions interact with Custom GPT instructions. Initially, there was confusion because:

- You asked whether Project-level prompts override Custom GPT instructions.
- I interpreted your question narrowly, assuming you meant Project instructions vs standard chat prompts, not specifically Custom GPTs launched within a Project.

---

### 🧠 Why did this misunderstanding happen?

1. **Assumed shared context.**  
   I defaulted to interpreting “system prompts” in the context of standard chats, without confirming you meant Custom GPTs.

2. **Ambiguity in terminology.**  
   “Folder-level system prompt” and “Custom GPT instructions” are technically different layers, but this distinction was not explicitly clarified early in the conversation.

3. **AI interpretive bias towards generalised knowledge.**  
   I provided general architectural explanations before checking the specific operational scenario you were referencing.

---

### ✅ How could this misunderstanding have been prevented?

- **Clarifying context explicitly at the outset.**  
  E.g. “In this question, I’m specifically asking about launching a Custom GPT chat within a Project with its own instructions.”

- **AI asking a context-confirming question before answering.**  
  E.g. “Are you referring to starting a standard chat with Project instructions, or launching a Custom GPT chat within that Project?”

- **Using a shared operational vocabulary.**  
  E.g. Consistent use of “Project instructions” vs “Custom GPT embedded instructions” vs “standard chat system prompts”.

### 🔬 Key Takeaway

The misunderstanding was not a hallucination, but a **contextual misalignment** rooted in:

- Assumptions about shared definitions and scope,  
- Lack of explicit context framing early in the interaction.

---

### 💡 Strategic Insight

To avoid similar communication friction in future AI-human interactions:

✅ Explicitly state scenario boundaries in your initial question.  
✅ AI should ask clarifying questions before providing general architectural explanations.  
✅ Establish and reinforce shared vocabulary for system components and prompt layers at the start of technical conversations.

### 📥 Why archive this chat?

This conversation exemplifies:

- How context assumption mismatches lead to misunderstandings even without factual hallucinations.  
- The importance of clarity, confirmatory questioning, and epistemic rigor in high-stakes AI-human workflows.  
- A robust model for reflecting on communication friction to strengthen future interactions and prompt engineering practices.
