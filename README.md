⚠️ A Word of Caution

Please note that 100% of this content has been created using generative AI, and I am not an expert.

Eventually, I hope for the output to be correct, and to have documented all of the hallucinations and misunderstandings, in order to get better at prompting, and also as an experiment to factually observe and document such erroneous outputs.
