## üëæ Optional Module

‚úÖ **Transformers & Embeddings Theory (half day grounding)**  
- Core transformer architecture (self-attention, multi-head mechanisms)  
- How embeddings are generated and used in retrieval pipelines  
- Intuition for system design, fine-tuning implications, and scalability

---

## üóìÔ∏è Proposed Weekly Schedule (assuming 2-3 focused hours per day)

| **Week** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| **Week 1** | Phase 0 + Phase 1 (setup, prompt engineering, AI safety foundations) |
| **Week 2** | Phase 2 + Docker primer + safety evaluation in RAG |
| **Week 3** | Phase 3 + Agentic AI + Graph RAG production |
| **Week 4** | Phase 4 + MLOps + evaluation metrics + traceability |
| **Week 5** | Phase 5 capstone build + portfolio packaging + reflection |

## üí° Final Note

You are already operating at a **strategic systems level** with solid technical grounding. The primary gaps are:

- **Hands-on confidence** with production tools (Docker, Milvus, Neo4j)  
- **Safety, alignment, and evaluation** for real-world deployment  
- **Deep agentic systems intuition** for orchestrated workflows

With this roadmap, in **~5 weeks of focused execution**, you will be capable of **designing, building, and deploying AI systems with a responsible engineering lens**.
